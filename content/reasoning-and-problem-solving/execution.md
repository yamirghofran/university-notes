## Open-loop
Problems for which the solution is a fixed sequence of actions, so we can ignore the percepts.

## Closed-loop
Problems where we have to check the percepts and updates because the [environment](/reasoning-and-problem-solving/environments) changes or our knowledge about it might not be perfect.
