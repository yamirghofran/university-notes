title: Competitive Games
---

There are three approaches to environments with competitive [agents](/reasoning-and-problem-solving/agents):

- Model them as an economy (appropriate for a large number of agents)
	- No need to predict the behavior of individuals, just the impact their actions have
- Model them as part of the environment, as if it was non-deterministic
	- if there is a mean genie that just moves walls around in a labyrinth
- Model the agent behavior in an adversarial game-tree search
	- what we will cover

 1. Fully observable, deterministic games
 2. Games of chance (removing the the deterministic assumption)
 3. Games with imperfect information (removing the fully observable assumptions)
