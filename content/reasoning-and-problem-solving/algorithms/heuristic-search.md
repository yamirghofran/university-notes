title: Heuristic Search
---

Heuristic search techniques are used for problem-solving in AI systems. These techniques help find the most efficient path from a starting point to a goal, making them essential for applications such as navigation systems, game playing, and optimization problems.

- Heuristic search operates within the search space of a problem to find the best or near-optimal solution using systematic algorithms.
- Unlike brute-force methods, which exhaustively evaluate all possible solutions, heuristic search leverages heuristic information to guide the search toward more promising paths.

In this context, **heuristics** refer to a set of criteria or rules of thumb that provide an estimate of the most viable solution. By balancing **exploration** (searching new possibilities) and **exploitation** (refining known solutions), heuristic algorithms efficiently solve complex problems that would otherwise be computationally expensive.
