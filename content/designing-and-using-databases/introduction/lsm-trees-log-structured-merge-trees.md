title: LSM-Trees (Log-Structured Merge Trees)
---

LSM-Trees or Log-Structured Merge Trees are a data structure used in modern databases for efficient storage and retrieval. They optimize write-intensive workloads.

## Structure
- LSM-Trees consist of multiple levels, including memory (memtable) and disk-based ([SSTables (Sorted String Tables)](/designing-and-using-databases/introduction/sstables-sorted-string-tables)) components.
- Data is sorted and stored in a series of [SSTables (Sorted String Tables)](/designing-and-using-databases/introduction/sstables-sorted-string-tables).

## How it works
1. Data is first written to a memory-based component called the memtable.
2. When the memtable is full, it's flushed to disk as an SSTable.
3. Read operations involve checking both the memtable and SSTables.
4. Periodic compaction merges and removes obsolete data from SSTables.


## Benefits and Challenges of LSM-Trees
### Benefits
- High Write Throughput
	- LSM-Trees are optimized for write-heavy workloads due to their append-only nature.
- Efficient Compaction
	- Compaction occurs at the background, reducing the impact on write performance.
- Range Queries
	- Sorted SSTables enable efficient range queries.

### Challenges
- Read Amplification
	- Multiple [SSTables (Sorted String Tables)](/designing-and-using-databases/introduction/sstables-sorted-string-tables) may need to be checked during reads, leading to read amplification.
- Complexity
	- LSM-Tree management and compaction can be complex.


## LSM-Trees Use Cases
LSM-Trees are commonly used in distributed and NoSQL databases like Apache [Cassandra](/designing-and-using-databases/cassandra), HBase, and LevelDB.

Ideal for applications with heavy write traffic, such as IoT data ingestion.
