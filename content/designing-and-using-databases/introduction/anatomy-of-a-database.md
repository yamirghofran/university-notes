title: Anatomy of a Database
---

Traditional databases consist of several components:
- **Tables**: Data is organized into tables, each representing a specific entity (eg customers, products).
- **Records**: Rows within tables, containing individual data entries.
- **Fields**: Columns within records, holding specific types of data (eg name, age, address).
- **Keys**: Unique identifiers used to link records between tables for efficient data retrieval.

The structure and relationships between these components define the database's schema.
