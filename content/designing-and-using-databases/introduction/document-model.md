---

The Document Model stores data as semi-structured documents (e.g. JSON, BSON)

**Flexibility**: Documents can have varying structures, making them suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.

**Scalability**: Document databases are know for horizontal scalability, making them ideal for handling dynamic datasets.

**Use Cases**: Document databases excel at content management, catalogs, user, profiles, and mores.

**Schema**: Schema-less or flexible schema, allowing documents to have dynamic structures within the same collection.

**Handling Data Relationships**: Embedded documents and references are used to represent relationships within documents.

**Querying and Performance**: Query languages designed for document databases(e.g. MongoDB Query Language) are optimized for for flexible data structures.
