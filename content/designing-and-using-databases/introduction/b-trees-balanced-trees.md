title: B-Trees (Balanced Trees)
---

B-trees are self-balancing tree data structures used in databases and file systems for efficient data management.
They maintain balance through various operations.

## Structure
- B-Trees are composed of nodes with a fixed number of child nodes.
- They have a root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.

## How it works
- Data is organized hierarchically in the tree.
- Each node stores a range of keys and their corresponding values.
- B-Trees maintain balance by redistributing keys during insertions and deletions.

## Structure of a B-Tree node (keys, pointers)
### Keys
- Each B-Tree node contains a set of keys.
- Keys are values used for indexing and searching data.
- Keys within a node are stored in sorted order.

### Pointers
- Along with keys, B-Tree nodes have corresponding pointers.
- Pointers are references to child nodes or data associated with the keys.
- The number of pointers in a node equals the number of keys plus one.

## Benefits and Challenges of B-Trees
### Benefits
- Balanced structure
	- B-Trees are self-balancing, ensuring that the tree remains relatively shallow and height-balanced.
	- Efficient searching
	- Provides efficient logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for search, insertions, and deletions.
- Ordered Data
	- Data is stored in a sorted order, making range queries efficient.
### Challenges
- Complexity
	- B-Trees require more complex maintenance than simpler data structures like arrays or linked lists.
- Not ideal for dynamic datasets
	- Frequent insertions and deletions can lead to tree rebalancing, impacting performance.
