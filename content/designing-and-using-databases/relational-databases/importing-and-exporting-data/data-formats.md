# CSV - Comma Separated Values
CSV is a plain text file format commonly used for tabular data.

Data is organized in rows and columns, where each row represents a record, and columns are separated by commas.

CSV is a lightweight, human-readable, and easy to generate and parse.

Example:
Name, Age, City
John, 30, New York
Jane, 25, Los Angeles

# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
Data is represented as key-value pairs and structured in a hierarchical format.
JSON is easy for both humans and machines to read and write:

```JSON
{
"Name": "John",
"Age": 30,
"City": "New York"
}
```

# XML
XML is a markup language used to encode structured data. Data is enclosed in tags, creating a tree-like structure.

XML is highly flexible and is often used for data interchange and configuration files.

```XML
<Person>
<Name>John</Name>
<Age>30</Age>
<City>New York</City>
</Person>
```
