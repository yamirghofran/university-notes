A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how devices on a network communicate with each other. These rules ensure consistent and efficient data exchange.
- [IP Protocol](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/networking/ip-protocol)
- [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/networking/transmission-control-protocol-tcp)
- ARP
	- Address Resolution Protocol
	- Communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
- ICMP
