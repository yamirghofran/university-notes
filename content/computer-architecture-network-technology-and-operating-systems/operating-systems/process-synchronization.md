## Critical Section Problem
![](../attachments/cleanshot-2025-02-21-at-1553062x.png)

The critical section problem is a fundamental issue in concurrent programming and operating systems, where multiple processes or threads need to access shared resources or data. The critical section is a segment of code that accesses shared resources and must be executed atomically, meaning no other process should interfere while it is being executed.
The problem arises because if multiple processes enter their critical sections simultaneously, it can lead to data inconsistency, race conditions, and other synchronization issues. The goal is to design a protocol that ensures mutual exclusion, meaning only one process can execute its critical section at a time, while also ensuring progress (no process is indefinitely postponed) and bounded waiting (there exists a bound on how many times other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted).
