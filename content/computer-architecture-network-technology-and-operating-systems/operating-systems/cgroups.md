title: Cgroups
---

Cgroups, also known as control groups, is a Linux kernel feature that allows system administrators to allocate and manage resources such as CPU, memory, I/O, and network bandwidth among a group of processes.
Key Features of Cgroups
- Resource Limitation: Cgroups can set limits on the amount of resources a group of processes can use.
- Prioritization: Cgroups can prioritize resource allocation among different groups of processes.
- Accounting: Cgroups can track and monitor resource usage by each group of processes.
- Isolation: Cgroups can isolate a group of processes from other processes on the system, preventing them from interfering with each other.
