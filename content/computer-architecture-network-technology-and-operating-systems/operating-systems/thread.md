title: Thread
---

-   **Definition**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a [Process](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/operating-systems/process). A process can contain multiple threads that share the same memory space.
-   **Memory**: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which allows for easier data sharing but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.
-   **Overhead**: Threads are lighter than processes. Creating and managing threads involves less overhead because they share the same memory and resources.
-   **Isolation**: Threads are not isolated from each other. A crash in one thread can potentially affect the entire process.
-   **Context Switching**: Context switching between threads is generally faster than between processes because threads share memory and other resources.

### Use Cases
-   **Threads** are useful when tasks need to share data frequently and require less isolation, such as in applications with a high degree of parallelism like web servers, where multiple threads handle different client requests.
