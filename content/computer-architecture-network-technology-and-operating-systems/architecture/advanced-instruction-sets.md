- Advanced Performance Extensions (APX)
	- provides a big jump in AI performance by introducing **two-dimensional matrix registers**.
- Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)
	- a set of instructions to perform **floating-point operations on multiple data elements** in parallel.
- SSE
	- an extension to perform single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations on **multiple data elements in parallel**
- BMI
	- Bit manipulation instructions.
- F16C
	- an extension to the x86 instruction set architecture that provides support for **converting between half-point precision and standard IEEE single-precision** floating-point formats.
- Floating Multiply Add (FMA)
