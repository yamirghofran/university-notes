## RISC
- Reduced instruction set computing.
- Small number of instructions that perform simple operations.
- Easy to memorize all the instructions, but a simple task requires many of them.
- The instructions are executed very quickly
- It is an architecture oriented towards parallelism ([[Y2Q2/Computer Architecture, Network Technology, and Operating Systems/Architecture/Pipeline|pipelining]]) and superscalarity.
- e.g. PowerPc, ARM, AVR, PIC

## CISC
- Complex instruction set computing.
- Architecture that contains a large number of instructions that perform complex operations.
- Difficult to learn all instructions, but with a few of them, complex tasks can be performed.
- Not suitable for parallelism (pipelining)
- e.g. 68000, Z80, x86
