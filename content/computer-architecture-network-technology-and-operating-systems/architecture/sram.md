- Doesn't need refreshing
- More expensive
- Lower density
- Used for [CPU](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cpu) [cache](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cache)
- Faster than [DRAM](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/dram)
