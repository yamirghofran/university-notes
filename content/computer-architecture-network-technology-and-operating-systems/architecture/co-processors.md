title: Co-Processors
---

A co-processor is a supplementary processor unit that is designed to complement the central processing unit ([CPU](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cpu)) of a computer.

Co-processors can perform specialized tasks such as complex mathematical calculations, graphical display processing, signal processing, string processing, [cryptography](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/crypto-processors), or I/O interfacing with [Peripherals](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/peripherals).

By offloading processor-intensive tasks from the main processor, co-processors can accelerate system performance.
