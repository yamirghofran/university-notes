title: Virtual Machines and Bytecode
---

A Virtual Machine is an abstract computing machine that provides a runtime environment in which bytecode can be executed.

The code is compiled to bytecode, which is a binary format that is independent of the hardware and [operating system](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/operating-systems/operating-system). The bytecode is stored in a file with the `.class/.pyc` extension. The VM reads the bytecode and executes it on the host platform.

In the context of Java, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.

From the OS perspective, [Virtualization](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/virtualization-technologies) is a technique that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
