title: UEFI
---

UEFI is a more modern replacement for [BIOS](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/bios).

- While [BIOS](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/bios) uses 16-bit code and is limited to a maximum of 1 MB of storage, UEFI uses 32-bit or 64-bit code and can access up to 128 MB of storage.
- UEFI also supports **Secure Boot**, which is a security feature that helps prevent unauthorized [operating system](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/operating-systems/operating-system)s from [booting](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/booting) on a computer.
- BIOS relies on the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme, which has limitations such as a maximum disk size of 2 TB and a maximum of four primary partitions. UEFI, on the other hand, uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme, which supports disks larger than 2 TB and allows for an unlimited number of partitions.
- UEFI also provides a more advanced user interface than BIOS, which allows users to interact with the firmware using a mouse and keyboard and includes support for graphics and animations.
