title: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
---

The Arithmetic and Logic Unit is the heart of the [CPU](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cpu). 

1. It takes an instruction code from [memory](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/memory) (Fetch) and 
2. connects the operation represented by that code to the [registers](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/registers) or memory that holds the inputs and that will hold the results (Decode) 
3. then the operation is executed (Issue).
