title: Heap
---

Heaps are memory areas allocated to each program. Memory allocated to heaps can be **dynamically allocated**, unlike memory allocated to [Stack](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/stack). As a result, the heap segment can be requested and released whenever the program needs it.

The heap segment provides a flexible area for storing large data structures and objects with dynamic lifetimes. Heap memory may be allocated or deallocated during the program execution.

Grows against the [Stack](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/stack).
