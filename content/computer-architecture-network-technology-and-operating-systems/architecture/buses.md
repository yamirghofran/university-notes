A bus is a shared pathway that enables the transfer of data between various hardware components, such as the central processing unit ([CPU](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cpu)), [memory](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/memory), input/output (I/O) devices, and other [peripherals](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/peripherals).
- [Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Bus](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/peripheral-component-interconnect-pci-bus)

- Address Bus
	- determines the location in memory that the processor will read data from or write data to.
- Data Bus
	- contains the contents that have been read from the memory location or are to be written into the memory location.
- Control Bus
	- manages the information flow between components indicating whether the operation is a read or a write and ensuring that the operation happens at the right time.
