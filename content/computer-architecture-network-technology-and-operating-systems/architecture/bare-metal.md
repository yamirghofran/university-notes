Running programs in a [CPU](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/cpu) without an [Operating System](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/operating-systems/operating-system) requires two main components:
- Basic [assembly](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/assembly) to initialize [Stack](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/stack) and [Memory](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/memory).
- Linker script defining memory regions to store data and code.
