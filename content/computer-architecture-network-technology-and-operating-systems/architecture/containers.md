title: Containers
---

- Containers are lighter than [Virtualization](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/virtualization-technologies) because they don't provide hardware and OS isolation.
- Docker uses **linux namespaces and cgroups** so there is no docker for windows
- Docker for windows run on a VM with linux
- Docker images contain all software dependencies needed to run programs and are usually designed to be as light as possible.
