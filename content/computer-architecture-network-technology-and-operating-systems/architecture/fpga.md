An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing. It consists of an array of programmable logic blocks and interconnects that can be configured to perform various digital functions.

Commonly used in applications where **flexibility**, **speed**, and **parallel processing** capabilities are required: 
- Telecommunications
- Self-driving cars
- Computer Vision

FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), like that used for an application-specific integrated circuit ([ASIC](/computer-architecture-network-technology-and-operating-systems/architecture/asic)).

FPGAs are also commonly used during the development of ASICs to speed up the simulation process.
