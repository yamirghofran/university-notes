Used to model systems or phenomena that evolve over time in a way that incorporates randomness or uncertainty.

Given a set $T$, a **stochastic process** $\{X(t), t \in T\}$ is a collection of random variables. That is, for each $t \in T$, $X(t)$ is a random variable.

- If T is countable, then the stochastic process is **discrete-time** (e.g [Markov Chains](/prob-cs/markov-chains)).
- If T is an interval, then the stochastic process is **continuous-time** (e.g. [Poisson Process](/prob-cs/poisson-process).)
