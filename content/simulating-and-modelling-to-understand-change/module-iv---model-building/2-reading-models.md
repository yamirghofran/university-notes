title: 2. Reading Models
---

There are two distinct ways that you can read a model.

- Read out the model value. Plug in specific values for the explanatory variables and read out the resulting model value. For instance, an input temperature of 35° produces a predicted output gas usage of 125 ccf.
 
- Characterize the relationship described by the model. In contrast to reading out a model value for some specific values of the explanatory variables, here interest is in the overall relationship: how gas usage “depends” on temperature.

Reading out the model value is useful when you want to make a prediction (What would the gas usage be if the temperature were 10° degrees?) or when you want to compare the actual value of the response variable to what the model says is a typical value. (Is the gas usage lower than expected in the 49° month, perhaps due to my new furnace?).

Characterizing the relationship is useful when you want to make statements about broad
patterns that go beyond individual cases. Is there really a connection between marital status and wage? Which way does it go?

The **shape** of the model function tells you about such broad relationships. Reading the shape from a graph of the model is not difficult.

For a **continuous explanatory variable**, e.g., temperature or age, the model form is a
continuous curve or line. An extremely important aspect of this curve is its **slope**. For the
model of gas usage, the slope is down to the right: a **negative slope. This means that as**
**temperature increases (x), the gas usage goes down (y)**.

For **categorical variables**, slopes don’t apply. Instead, the pattern can be described in terms of differences. We will see that in future sessions.

When **there is more than one explanatory/independent variable**, there will be a distinct slope or difference associated with each (multiple linear regression models).
