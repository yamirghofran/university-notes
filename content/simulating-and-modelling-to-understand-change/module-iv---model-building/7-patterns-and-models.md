title: 7. Patterns and Models
---

**Patterns in your data provide clues about relationships**. If a systematic
relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. If
you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

- Could this pattern be due to coincidence (ie random chance)?
- How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?
- How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?
- What other variables might affect the relationship?
- Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

Patterns provide one of the most useful tools in modeling because they reveal
covariation. If you think of variation as a phenomenon that creates uncertainty,
covariation is a phenomenon that reduces it.

**If two variables covariate, you can use the values of one variable to make better**
**predictions about the values of the second**. If the covariation is due to a causal
relationship (a special case), then you can use the value of one variable to control
the value of the second.
