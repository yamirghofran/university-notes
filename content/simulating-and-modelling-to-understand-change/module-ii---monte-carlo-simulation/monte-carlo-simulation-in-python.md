A Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated sampling to obtain the statistical
properties of some phenomenon (or behavior). For example: drawing a large
number of pseudo-random uniform variables from the interval [0,1] at one
time, or once at many different times, and assigning values less than or equal
to 0.50 as heads and greater than 0.50 as tails, is a Monte Carlo simulation of
the behavior of repeatedly tossing a coin.

The main idea of this[ method](/simulating-and-modelling-to-understand-change/module-ii---monte-carlo-simulation/the-monte-carlo-method) is that a **phenomenon is simulated multiple times**
**on a computer by generating random numbers and the results are aggregated to**
**provide statistical summaries associated with the phenomenon**.
Sawilowsky lists the[ characteristics](/simulating-and-modelling-to-understand-change/module-ii---monte-carlo-simulation/characteristics-of-a-monte-carlo-simulation) of a high-quality Monte Carlo simulation.

# Conclusions
Throughout this module we have learned how to carry out a simulation using Monte
Carlo methods, and to make inferences from the results of the simulated experiments.
The concepts acquired have been applied to concrete experiments, developing the
steps of a Monte Carlo simulation in very different contexts.
In the Lab of this module you will face problems with similar dynamics, but keep in
mind that each Monte Carlo simulation is totally unique, and you will have to develop
the code from scratch.
