title: The Monte Carlo Method
---

Monte Carlo method was developed by **Stanislaw Ulam** and **John von Neumann** in the mid-1940s during the Manhattan Project for **early work relating to the development of nuclear weapons**.

A Monte Carlo method is a technique that can be used to solve a
mathematical or statistical problem. For example: Pouring out a box of coins
on a table, and then computing the ratio of coins that land heads versus tails
is a Monte Carlo method of determining the behavior of repeated coin tosses,
but it is not a simulation.
