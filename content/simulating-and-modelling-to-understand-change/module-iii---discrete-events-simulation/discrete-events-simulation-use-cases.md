### Logistics and Supply Chain
DES is used to model and optimize processes in supply chains and logistics
systems. It enables researchers and practitioners to analyze material flow,
inventory management, transportation, and distribution, identifying bottlenecks
and assessing the impact of different management strategies.

### Telecommunications Networks
In telecommunications, DES helps model network traffic, resource allocation, and
the performance of communication protocols. This is crucial for designing and
analyzing efficient networks, evaluating quality of service (QoS), and quality of
experience (QoE) under various conditions and traffic loads.

### Manufacturing Systems
Applied to simulate production processes and manufacturing operations, DES
facilitates decision-making related to production planning, plant design,
production capacity management, and operation sequencing optimization. This
helps improve efficiency and reduce costs and wait times.

### Healthcare Services
DES allows for modeling healthcare systems, including patient flows, hospital
operations, and emergency services management. It is used to enhance the
quality and efficiency of healthcare services, plan resources, and evaluate public
health policies.

### Traffic and Transportation
Widely used to analyze transportation systems, including urban network traffic,
airport operations, and mass transit systems. It enables the assessment of
various transportation policies, urban planning, and traffic management strategies.

### Computer Systems and Software
In software development and computer systems management, DES is used to
model execution processes, algorithms, and hardware architectures, allowing for
the assessment of performance, scalability, and reliability of computer systems.
