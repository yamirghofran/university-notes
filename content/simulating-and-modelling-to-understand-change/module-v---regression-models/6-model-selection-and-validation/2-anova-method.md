title: 2. ANOVA Method
---

We already noticed that the summary function for a linear model gives us the result of the test comparing the fitted model against the one where no predictors are included.

We would obtain the same result fitting a model with no predictors and then using the command anova.

```python
model_0 = smf.ols(formula = "Fertility ~ 1", data = swiss).fit()
anova_lm(model_0, model_1)
```

The same approach can be used to compare any two models that are **nested** between each other, meaning where one is a generalization of the other (i.e. it includes more predictors, it includes additional interactions and so on).

Letâ€™s see if the models with all predictors (model) and the model where we dropped one predictor (model2) are **significantly different**.

`anova_lm(model_2, model_1)`

Indeed they are not, since we noticed that the variable Examination is not useful to predict the response.
