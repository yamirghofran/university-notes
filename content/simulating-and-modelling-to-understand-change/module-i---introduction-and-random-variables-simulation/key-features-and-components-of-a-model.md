title: Key Features and Components of a Model
---

A [Model](/simulating-and-modelling-to-understand-change/module-i---introduction-and-random-variables-simulation/model) is a simplification of reality. It doesn't capture all the complexities of the actual phenomenon but focuses on the most relevant aspects for the purpose of the analysis.

**Variables**: Can be independent (predictors) or dependent (responses). Independent variables are those considered as potential causes or influences, while dependent variables are the effects or outcomes that are studied.

**Parameters**: Coefficients in the model that quantify the relationship between the variables. These parameters are estimated from the data.

**Use of Data**: Statistical models are built and validated using data. This data can come form experiments, surveys, historical records, etc...

## Types of Models
There are various types of models, including linear, non-linear, parametric, non-parametric, etc. The choice of the model depends on the nature of the data and the phenomenon being studied. In this course we will discuss the fundamentals of **linear regression and binary logistic regression models**.

**Linear Regression** is used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The model assumes a linear relationship between the variables. Linear regression is then used with a **continuous dependent variable**.

**Binary Logistic Regression** is used when the dependent variable is binary (i.e., it has only two possible outcomes, often coded as 0 and 1). It models the probability of a particular outcome as a function of the independent variables. Binary logistic regression is then used with a binary **discrete dependent variable**.
