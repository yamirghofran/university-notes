1. **Problem Definition and Data Collection**: Clearly identify the problem to be studied and collect relevant data.
2. **Data Exploration and Preparation**: Includes cleaning, transforming, and initially exploring the data to understand its characteristics and relationships.
3. **Model Selection**: Based on prior knowledge and the nature of the data, an appropriate statistical model is chosen.
4. **Parameter Estimation**: Use estimation methods to calculate the model's parameters.
5. **Model Verification and Validation**: Check the quality of the model through various tests and diagnostic methods.
6. **Interpretation of Results**: Interpret the results of the model in the context of the study problem.
7. **Use of the Model for Prediction or Inference**: Apply the model to make predictions about new data or to make inferences about the studied population.
