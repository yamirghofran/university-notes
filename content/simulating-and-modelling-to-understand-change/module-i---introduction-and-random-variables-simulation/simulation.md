A **simulation** is an imitation of the dynamics of a real-world process or [system](/simulating-and-modelling-to-understand-change/module-i---introduction-and-random-variables-simulation/system) over time. 

The behavior of the **system** is studied by constructing a [simulation model](/simulating-and-modelling-to-understand-change/module-i---introduction-and-random-variables-simulation/elements-of-a-simulation-model), which usually takes the form of a set of assumptions about the workings of the system. Once developed, a simulation model can be used for a variety of tasks:
- **Investigate the behavior of the system under a wide array of scenarios.** This is also often referred to as a "what-if" analysis.
- Changes to the system can be simulated before implementation to predict their impact in real-world.
- During the design stage of a system, meaning while it's being built, simulation can be used to guide its construction.

Used in many domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, consumer behavior, transport systems, defense and management science, etc.

### Why Simulate?
Vs. direct experimentation.
- It's **cheaper** to implement and doesn't require a **disruption** of a real-world system.
- It's **faster** to implement and can be **compressed or expanded** to allow for a speed-up or a slow-down of the system of interest.
- It can be **replicated multiple times** and the workings of the system can be observed a large number of times.
- It's **safer** since it doesn't require an actual disruption of the system.
- It's **ethical and legal** since it can implement changes in policies that would be unethical or illegal to do in real-world.

Another alternative is to use a deterministic model representing the system. However, it is often infeasible, if not impossible, to come up with an exact mathematical model which can faithfully represent the system under study.
