### Expectation
The **expectation or mean** of a random variable X dented as E(X) is defined as $$E(X) = \sum_{x \in X} xp(x)$$
The expectation can be interpreted as the mean value of a large number of observations from the random variable X.

### Variance

$$V(X) = E((X - E(X))^2) = E(X^2)-E(X)^2 = \sum_{x \in X} (x - E(X))^2 p(x)$$
