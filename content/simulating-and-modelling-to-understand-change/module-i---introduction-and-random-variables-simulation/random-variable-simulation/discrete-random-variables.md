title: Discrete Random Variables
---

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes.

Random variables are often designated by letters and can be classified as **discrete**, which are variables that have specific values, or **[[Y1Q2/Simulating and Modelling to Understand Change/Module I - Introduction & Random Variables Simulation/Random Variable Simulation/Continuous Random Variables|continuous]]**, which are variables that can have any values within a continuous range.

The use of random variables is most common in probability and statistics, where they are used to quantify **outcomes of random occurrences**.

**Random variables are required to be measureable and are typically real numbers.**

For example, the letter X may be designated to represent the sum of the resulting numbers after three dice are rolled.

**A random variable is different from an algebraic variable**

The **variable in an algebraic equation is an unknown value that can be calculated**. e.g. x+7=10

A **random variable** has a set of values, and any of those values could be the resulting outcome.

A random variable has a **probability distribution** that represents the **likelihood** that any of possible values would occur. It can be discrete or continuous.

**Variable**: There is some process that takes some value. It is a synonym of function as you have studied in other mathematics classes.

**Random**: The variable takes values according to some probability distribution.

**Discrete**: This refers to the possible values that the variable can take. In this case, it is a countable (possibly infinite) set of values.

In general, we denote a random variable as X and its possible values as $X=\{X_1, X_2, X_3,...\}$.
Examples:
- Number of donuts sold in a day in a shop {0,1,2,3,...}. Non-negative integers, infinite values.
- Outcome of a Covid-19 test {0,1}
- Number shown on the face of a dice {1,2,3,4,5,6}
