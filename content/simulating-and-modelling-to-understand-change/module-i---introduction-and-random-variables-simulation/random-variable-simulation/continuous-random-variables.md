title: Continuous Random Variables
---

A continuous random variable X is a random variable whose sample space 𝕏 is an interval or a collection of intervals. In general 𝕏 may coincide with the set of real numbers ℝ or some subset of it. Examples of continuous random variables:

- the pressure of a tire of a car: it can be any positive real number;
- the current temperature in the city of Madrid: it can be any real number;
- the height of the students of Simulation and Modeling to understand change;

Whilst for discrete random variables we considered summations over the elements of 𝕏, **for continuous random variables we need to consider integrals** over the appropriate intervals.

**This is because a discrete variable can assume a countable number of values within a set (which can be finite or infinite), but not all of them.** For example, the number of children in a family, the number of animals in a farm, the number of employees in a company...

Whereas, a **continuous variable is one that can assume an uncountable number of values within an interval (infinite)**. For example, the volume of water in a swimming pool, the weight or height of a person, the speed at which a train travels...

**A variable that can take any of the values between two given numbers is a continuous variable, otherwise it is a discrete variable.**

In the case of continuous variables, we measure **the probability that X takes a value within an interval by integrating to get the area under the curve.**
