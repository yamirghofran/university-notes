title: Reduced Row Echelon Form
---

1. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first non-zero number in the row is a 1. **leading 1**.
2. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then they are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
3. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros, the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in that column.

A matrix that has the first three properties is said to be in **row echelon form**.
