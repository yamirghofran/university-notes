title: Vector

A **vector** is a mathematical object that has both **magnitude** (length or size) and **direction**. It is often represented graphically as an arrow in a coordinate system, with the length of the arrow representing the magnitude and the direction of the arrow representing the direction.
Number of elements of a vector is called **dimensionality**.
**Key characteristics:**
- **Magnitude** (or length): The size or amount of the vector, often denoted by the symbol ||v|| or |v|.
- **Direction**: The orientation of the vector in space, often represented by the unit vector (a vector with a magnitude of 1) in the same direction.
- **Components**: The vector can be broken down into its component parts, often represented as (x, y) in 2-dimensional space or (x, y, z) in 3-dimensional space.
**Notation:**
- Vectors are often denoted by boldface letters, such as **v** or **a**.
- The magnitude of a vector **v** is denoted by ||**v**|| or |**v**|.
- The unit vector in the same direction as **v** is denoted by **v**/||**v**|| or **รป**.
**Examples:**
- A displacement vector: an object moves from point A to point B, the vector represents the direction and distance of the movement.
- A force vector: a force applied to an object, the vector represents the direction and magnitude of the force.
