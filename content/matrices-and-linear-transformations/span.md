title: Span

The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. It is denoted by span(**v1**, **v2**, ..., **vn**) or Span(**V**), where **V** is the set of vectors {**v1**, **v2**, ..., **vn**}.

**Formally:**

Given a set of vectors **V** = {**v1**, **v2**, ..., **vn**} in a vector space, the span of **V** is defined as:

span(**V**) = {**v** | **v** = a1**v1** + a2**v2** + ... + an**vn**, where ai ∈ ℜ}

In other words, the span of **V** consists of all vectors that can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in **V**, where the coefficients ai are real numbers.

**Key properties:**

• The span of a set of vectors is a subspace of the original vector space.

• The span of a set of vectors contains all the original vectors.

• The span of a set of vectors is the smallest subspace that contains all the original vectors.

**Geometric interpretation:**

- In 2-dimensional space, the span of two non-parallel vectors is the entire plane.
- In 2-dimensional space, the span of two parallel vectors is a line.
- In 3-dimensional space, the span of three non-coplanar vectors is the entire space.
- In 3-dimensional space, the span of two non-parallel vectors is a plane.
- In 3-dimensional space, the span of two parallel vectors is a line.

**Examples:**

- The span of the standard basis vectors {**i**, **j**} in 2-dimensional space is the entire plane.
- The span of the standard basis vectors {**i**, **j**, **k**} in 3-dimensional space is the entire space.
- The span of the vectors {**v1**, **v2**} is the line or plane that contains both **v1** and **v2**, depending on whether they are parallel or not.

This definition and explanation of span can be a useful addition to your Zettlekasten notes on linear algebra. You can connect it to other concepts, such as linear independence, basis, and dimension, to deepen your understanding of the subject.
