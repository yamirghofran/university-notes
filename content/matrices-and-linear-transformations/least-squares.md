## Exercise
- Fit a line by points (-2, 1), (0, 2), (2, 4). Find c, d where y = c + dx. Draw function and points with GeoGebra.

## Least Squares with Multiple Unknowns
Fitting by the best parabola has 3 coefficients c, d, e to solve for a parabola $y=c+dx+ex^2$ where x is independent variable and y is dependent variable of x.

## Exercise
- Find the parabola that gives the best least squares approximation to the points: (-1,1), (0,-1),(1,0), and (2,2). $y=c+dx+ex^2$
