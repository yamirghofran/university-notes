Sure! Here are some practice problems to help you balance chemical equations using linear equations:

### Problem 1:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_3H_8 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 2:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ CH_4 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 3:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_2H_6 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 4:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_4H_{10} + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 5:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_5H_{12} + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 6:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ N_2 + H_2 \rightarrow NH_3 \]

### Problem 7:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2O \]

### Problem 8:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_2H_4 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 9:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_3H_6 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Problem 10:
Balance the following chemical equation:
\[ C_6H_{14} + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]

### Steps to Solve:
1. Assign variables to the coefficients of each substance.
2. Write equations for each element to ensure the total number of atoms is the same on both sides.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of the variables.
4. Adjust the coefficients to the smallest whole-number integers.

These problems will help you practice balancing chemical equations using the method of linear equations.
