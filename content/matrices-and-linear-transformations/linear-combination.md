title: Linear Combination
---

If $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_r$ are matrices of the same size, and if $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r$ are scalars, then an expression of the form

$$
c_1A_1 + c_2A_2 + \cdots + c_rA_r
$$

is called a **linear combination** of $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_r$ with **coefficients** $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r$.
