title: What is Physics?
---

Physics is the study of **movement**. A subset of those movements occur at the atomic scale, like the exchange of electrons between atoms and ions, and it is what we call **Chemistry**.

Movement is omnipresent in any aspect of nature and our everyday life, from the stock market's ups and downs, the spread of disease in populations, or the spread of news in social media. A gratifying surprise in Physics is to find that the same ideas and equations used to describe electrons, sound or heat, are later on exploited to model the behavior of other complex biological, economic or social systems that apparently had nothing to do at first sight. This way, it's fruitful to think of Physics as the study of **dynamical systems**, regardless of the specifics of the system under consideration.

Even if you are not interested in quantum particles or black holes, knowing the basic concepts of Physics allow you to view the world through valuable lenses in other disciplines.
