title: Transient and Steady State
---

In a steady state with a capacitor in series, there is no current. (Open circuit)

In a steady state, with a solenoid, the voltage on the sides of the solenoid will be 0. (Short circuit, all the current will go the 0-resistance path (the solenoid))
$$V=L \frac{di}{dt}$$
DC motor: Resistor in parallel with a solenoid(inductor)
