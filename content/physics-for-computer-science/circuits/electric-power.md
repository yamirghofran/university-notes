title: Electric Power
---

Electric power is work per unit time done by the electric field. In a circuit, this concides with the rate at which energy is either delivered to or extracted from a circuit.



## Power dissipated by a resistor
- The electric energy dissipated by resistor is transformed into other energy forms. In a pure resistance, temperature of the resistor increases and there is a flow of heat out of it. In a light bulb, part of the energy is transformed into light. 
- Every resistor has a power rating, the maximum power the device can dissipate without becoming overheated and damaged.

$$P=VI=I^2R$$
$$V=IR$$
