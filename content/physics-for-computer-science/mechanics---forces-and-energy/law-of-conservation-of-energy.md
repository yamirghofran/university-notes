title: Law of Conservation of Energy
---

There are other forms of energy apart from mechanical energy (like heat). Taking into account all sorts of energy, energy is never created or destroyed; it only changes form. No exception to this rule has ever been found.

Example: for an isolated system, experiments show that the mechanical energy lost by dissipative forces is used to increase the internal energy of the system, raising the temperature.
