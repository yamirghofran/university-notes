title: Free Body Diagrams
---

A free-body diagram consists of the following elements:
* A representation of the body on which Newton's laws are applied.
* All the individual **external** forces acting **on** the body
* A coordinate system (conveniently chosen)
* accelerations can be included if needed as well.

When a problem involves more than one body, we can always draw a separate free-body diagram for each body
