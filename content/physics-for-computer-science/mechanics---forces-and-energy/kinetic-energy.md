title: Kinetic Energy
---

Defining the function $$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$, called kinetic energy, the [Work-energy Theorem](/physics-for-computer-science/mechanics---forces-and-energy/work-energy-theorem) reads

$$W=(K_2-K_1)=\Delta K$$

Properties

- Same units as work
- the kinetic energy of a particle is a scalar quantity; it depends on only the particle's mass and speed
- Kinetic energy can never be negative, and it is zero only when the particle is at rest.
- the kinetic energy can be though of as the total work need to accelerate a body from rest to its present speed.
- Power can be interpreted as the rate at which the kinetic energy of the system changes.
- So work done on a body alters the kinetic energy. Let's be careful though, the total kinetic energy of a *composite* system can change even if no work is done.
