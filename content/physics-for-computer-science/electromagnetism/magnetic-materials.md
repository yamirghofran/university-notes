**Magnetization** is defined as the number of atomic/molecular moments per unit volume in a certain material.
$$\vec{M}=\frac{{{d\vec\mu}}}{dV}$$
* **Paramagnetic materials**: atomic moments tend to align with some external magnetic field. The resulting magnetization creates an internal magnetic field that **reinforces** the externally applied magnetic field.

* **Diagmagnetic materials**: **induced** atomic moments tend to align in opposite direction with some external magnetic field. The resulting magnetization creates an internal magnetic field that **weakens** the externally applied magnetic field.

Inside of these materials, many times we can simply replace $\mu_0$ in our previous equations by
$$\mu=\mu_{r} \mu_{0}$$
where $\mu$ is the **permeability** of the material and $\mu_r$ is the **relative permeability**.
We can also define the **magnetic susceptibility**
$$\chi_m=\mu_r-1$$

| Material         | $\chi_m$(T=20ยบ) |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Platinum         | 26              |
| Aluminum         | 2.2             |
| Sodium           | 0.72            |
| Oxygen gas       | 0.19            |
| Bismuth          | -16.6           |
| Mercury          | - 2.9           |
| Silver           | -2.6            |
| Carbon (diamond) | -2.1            |
| Lead             | -1.8            |
| Sodium chloride  | -1.4            |
| Copper           | -1.0            |

### Ferromagnetism
**Ferromagnetism**: magnetic moments tend to align **even if there is no externally applied magnetic field**. Their behavior is therefore **nonlinear**. Magnets are actually ferromagnetic.
