title: Electric Dipole

A dipole consists of two opposite charges of equal sizes at a relatively small distance.

- Characterized by a **electric dipole moment** $\vec p=q\vec d$ where $\vec d$ is the vector that goes from the negative to the positive charge.

- Why is it important? because it simplest **model** of an inhomogeneous charge distribution with zero net charge. At a long enough distance, any inhomogeneous charge distribution looks like a dipole.

## Potential Energy of an Electric Dipole
It's not difficult to prove that the potential energy of a dipole in an electric field $\vec E$ is

$$U=-\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}$$

- maximum when $\vec{p}$ is parallel to $\vec{E}$, minimum when it is perpendicular. As any mechanical system, the dipole will try to minimize the potential energy.
