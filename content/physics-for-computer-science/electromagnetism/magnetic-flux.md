title: Magnetic Flux
---

Analogously to the electric flux, the magnetic flux is a measure of how much magnetic field crosses a certain surface.
$$\Phi_{B}=\int \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{A}=\int B \cos \phi d A$$
where $\phi$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal vector $\hat n$. The quantity $B\cos\phi$ is the perpendicular component of the electric field with respect to the surface.

- The SI unit of magnetic flux is the **weber** (Wb) in honor of the German physicist Wilhelm Weber (1804â€“1891), $\mathrm{I} \mathrm{Wb}=1 \mathrm{T} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2}$
- Geometrically, it quantifies how many magnetic field lines are crossing the surface.
