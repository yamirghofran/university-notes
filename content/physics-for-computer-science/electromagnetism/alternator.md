title: Alternator
---

An alternator (alternating-current generator or **AC generator**) is a device that induces an **alternating [emf](/physics-for-computer-science/electromagnetism/electromotive-force-emf)** in a coil. The coil rotates with constant angular velocity inside a constant and uniform [Magnetic Field](/physics-for-computer-science/electromagnetism/magnetic-field).

Applying [Faraday's law](/physics-for-computer-science/electromagnetism/faradays-law)

$$\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d \Phi_{B}}{d t}=-\frac{d}{d t}(B A \cos \omega t)=\omega B A \sin \omega t$$

- The alternator converts **mechanical rotational energy into electric energy**.
- A commutator or a rectifier is needed to produce direct current (DC), exactly as in the DC motor.
