title: Polarization
---

Charging is not the only way to activate electric forces...

A charged body can exert forces even on objects that are not charged themselves. Why? Due to an **inhomogeneous** charge distribution. 
- In a metal: electrons accumulate in a certain region as they can move freely
- In an insulator: induced dipoles orientate towards the charged body. 
- In polar liquids: molecules orientate towards the charged body.
