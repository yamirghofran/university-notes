title: Precision
---

The proportion of true positive results in all positive predictions made by the classifier.
$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}$$
- Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- Useful when the cost of **false positives** is high (e.g., spam detection).
