title: Dealing with Missing Attributes
---

Sometimes, data might be in a [tidy](/machine-learning-foundations/raw-and-tidy-data) form but have missing attributes.

Common attributes for dealing with missing attributes are:
- Removing the examples with missing attributes from the dataset (if your dataset is big enough to safely sacrifice some data).
- Using a learning algorithm that can deal with missing attribute values (e.g. the [decision tree](/machine-learning-foundations/decision-tree) learning algorithm)
- Using a [Data Imputation](/machine-learning-foundations/data-imputation) technique.
