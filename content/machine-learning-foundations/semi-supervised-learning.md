title: Semi-Supervised Learning
---

Uses datasets containing a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance.

### Goal
Same goal as [supervised learning](/machine-learning-foundations/supervised-learning) but with reduced [cost](/machine-learning-foundations/ml-cost) (less labeling), and improved **generalization** leveraging the structure in unlabeled data to improve model performance.
