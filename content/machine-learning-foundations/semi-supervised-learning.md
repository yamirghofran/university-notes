title: Semi-Supervised Learning
---

Uses datasets containing a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance.

### Goal
Same goal as [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Supervised Learning|Supervised Learning]] but with reduced [cost](/machine-learning-foundations/ml-cost) (less labeling), and improved **generalization** leveraging the structure in unlabeled data to improve model performance.
