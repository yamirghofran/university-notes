# Approaches 
## ML Data Scientists + Software Engineers
-  Specialization of each team member
	ML scientists devise effective models for the given goal(s); software engineers implement efficient and maintainable code.
- Well-defined skillsets with a common language.
	ML scientists know ML theory/techniques and software engineers know ML frameworks and SE principles/patterns/best practices.
- Everyone understands what is needed but not how it is done.
## ML Software Engineers
- Scientists are hard to integrate with software engineering teams.
- Scientists may devise solutions that are impractical and cannot be effectively executed in the production environment.
- Scientists don't usually write efficient, well-structured code.
- Software engineers have to rewrite models into production code, possibly incurring in overheads and additional costs.

# Skills and Roles
## Data Engineers
- Software engineers that extract, transform, and load (ETL) data.
- Create an automated pipeline, in which raw data is transformed into analysis-ready data.
- Design how to structure the data and how to integrate them from various resources.
- Write on-demand queries or fast application programming interfaces (APIs) to make data easily accessible by analysts and other data consumers.
- Not expected to know any machine learning.
## Data Labelers
- Manually or semi-automatically assign labels to unlabeled examples according to the specification provided by data analysts.
- Building labeling tools.
- Manage outsourced labelers
- Validate labeled examples for quality.
## Domain Experts
- Work closely with scientists and engineers
- Contribute to decide about model inputs, outputs, features and prediction objectives.
- Contribute to [feature engineering](/machine-learning-foundations/feature-engineering) by indicating how data relates to business decisions.
- Contribute to translate a business problem into a ML by indicating what the clients pay for and what is a deal-breaker for them.
## DevOps Engineers
- Work closely with machine learning engineers to automate model deployment, loading, monitoring, and occasional or regular model maintenance.
- Smaller companies and startups: may be part of the ML team, or an ML engineer could be responsible for devops.
- Big companies: work in larger Devops team and are employed in ml projects.
- MLOps: deploy machine learning models in production, upgrade those models, and build data processing pipelines involving ml models.
