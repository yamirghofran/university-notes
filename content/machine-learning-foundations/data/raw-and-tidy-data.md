title: Raw and Tidy Data
---

## Raw Data
Data in the format in which they were collected. e.g. word documents, PDF, data series from an instrument, transcriptions, interviews, etc.

## Tidy Data
Data needs to be converted into a format suitable for [[Machine Leaning]], i.e., a set of [Feature Vector](/machine-learning-foundations/feature-engineering/feature-vector)s. E.g. spreadsheet (but also matrices or tensors) where each row represents an example, and each column a feature of the examples.
