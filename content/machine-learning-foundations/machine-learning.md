title: Machine Learning
---

A set of computational methods and algorithms to
- Collect a dataset
- Train a statistical model based on that dataset
- 'infer' features of unseen data, somehow related to those learned in the given dataset.

ML algorithms use one of four main learning paradigms
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Supervised Learning|Supervised Learning]]
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Semi-Supervised Learning|Semi-Supervised Learning]]
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Unsupervised Learning|Unsupervised Learning]]
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Reinforcement Learning|Reinforcement Learning]]

There are other differentiators as well:
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Shallow vs Deep Learning|Shallow vs Deep Learning]]
- [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Model-Based vs Instance-Based Learning|Model-Based vs Instance-Based Learning]]
