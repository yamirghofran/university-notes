title: Machine Learning
---

A set of computational methods and algorithms to
- Collect a dataset
- Train a statistical model based on that dataset
- 'infer' features of unseen data, somehow related to those learned in the given dataset.

ML algorithms use one of four main learning paradigms
- [Supervised Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/supervised-learning)
- [Semi-Supervised Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/semi-supervised-learning)
- [Unsupervised Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/unsupervised-learning)
- [Reinforcement Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/reinforcement-learning)

There are other differentiators as well:
- [Shallow vs Deep Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/shallow-vs-deep-learning)
- [Model-Based vs Instance-Based Learning](/machine-learning-foundations/model-based-vs-instance-based-learning)
