title: R-squared
---

A statistical measure indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Range**: Typically between 0 and 1.
## Interpretation
- **0**: Model explains none of the variability.
- **1**: Model explains all the variability.
## Purpose
Assesses goodness-of-fit in regression models; higher values suggest a better fit, though context matters.
## Limitations
  - Does not indicate causality.
  - Can be misleading with non-linear relationships or overfitting.
  - Sensitive to the number of predictors: adding variables may increase R-squared even if they don't improve predictive power.
## Complementary measures
Adjusted R-squared accounts for model complexity, providing a more accurate assessment in models with multiple predictors.
