title: Dimensionality Reduction
---

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial technique in machine learning and data analysis that aims to reduce the number of random variables under consideration and avoid [The Curse of Dimensionality](/machine-learning-foundations/feature-engineering/the-curse-of-dimensionality) by obtaining a set of principal variables. This process helps in simplifying models, reducing computational costs, and improving the interpretability of the data. Here are some key aspects and techniques of dimensionality reduction.
