title: Feedback Loop
---

A **feedback loop** is a property in the system design when the data used to train the model is obtained using the model itself. 

Imagine that you work on a problem of predicting whether a specific user of a website will like the content, and you only have indirect labels â€“ clicks. If the model is already deployed on the website and the users click on links recommended by the model, this means that the new data indirectly reflects not only the interest of users to the content, but also how intensively the model recommended that content. If the model decided that a specific link is important enough to recommend to many users, more users would likely click on that link, especially if the recommendation was made repeatedly during several days or weeks.
