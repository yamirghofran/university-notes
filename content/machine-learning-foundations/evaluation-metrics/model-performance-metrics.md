title: Model Performance Metrics
---

A good model is a model that performs well on the [Testing Dataset](/machine-learning-foundations/data/training-and-holdout-datasets), i.e. generalizes well.

## Regression
- [Mean Squared Error](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/mean-squared-error)
- [Median Absolute Error](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/median-absolute-error)
- [Almost Correct Prediction Error Rate](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/almost-correct-prediction-error-rate)
## Classification
- [Precision](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/precision)
- [Recall](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/recall)
- [Accuracy](/machine-learning-foundations/evaluation-metrics/accuracy), and cost-sensitive and per-class accuracy.
