---

The proportion of true positive results in all actual positive cases.
$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$$

- Evaluates the ability to find all relevant instances.
- Important when the cost of **false negatives** is high (e.g., disease detection).
