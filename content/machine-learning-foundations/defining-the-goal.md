title: Defining the Goal
---

The goal of an ML project is to build a model that (helps to) solve a business problem.

## Typical Purposes
-  **Automate**, e.g., take action on the user's behalf, start/stop a specific activity, etc.
-  **Alert or prompt**, e.g., ask the user if an action should be taken; alert a sysadmin about potentially suspicious network traffic.
-  **Organize**, e.g., sort pictures or documents in the order of similarity to a query or according to the user’s preferences.
-  **Annotate**, e.g., add contextual annotations to displayed information, or highlight phrases relevant to the user’s task in a text.
-  **Extract**, e.g., detect smaller pieces of relevant information in a larger input, such as named entities in the text: proper names, companies, or locations.
-  **Recommend**, e.g., detect and show to a user highly relevant items in a large collection based on item’s content or user’s reaction to the past recommendations.
-  **Classify**, e.g., dispatch input examples into one, or several, of a predefined set of distinctly-named groups.
-  **Quantify**, e.g., assign a number, such as a price, to an object, such as a house.
-  **Synthesize**, e.g., generate new text, image, sound similar to the objects in a collection.
-  **Answer a question**, e.g., “Does this text describe that image?”, “are these images similar?”
-  **Transform its input**, e.g., reduce its dimensionality for visualization purposes, paraphrase a long text as a short abstract, translate a sentence into another language, or augment an image by applying a filter to it.
-  **Detect a novelty or an anomaly**, e.g., fraud detection in financial transactions or predictive maintenance in manufacturing.
