title: Loss Function
---

A loss function, also known as a **cost function** or **objective function**, is a mathematical function that quantifies the difference between the predicted values of a machine learning model and the actual values from the training data. It is used to measure the performance of the model during training and to guide the optimization process.

## Types of Loss Functions
- [Mean Squared Error](/machine-learning-foundations/mean-squared-error)
- [Mean Absolute Error](/machine-learning-foundations/mean-absolute-error)
- [Cross-Entropy Loss](/machine-learning-foundations/cross-entropy-loss)
	- Binary Cross-Entropy
	- Categorical Cross-Entropy
- [Hinge Loss](/machine-learning-foundations/hinge-loss)
## Importance of Loss Functions
-  **Model Training**: Guides the optimization process by providing a quantitative measure of model performance.
-  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Helps in selecting the best [Hyperparameter](/machine-learning-foundations/parameters-and-hyperparameters)s by comparing the loss values.
-  **Model Evaluation**: Provides a way to evaluate and compare different models.

## Choosing a Loss Function
-  **Task Type**: Different tasks (regression, classification, etc.) require different loss functions.
-  **Data Distribution**: The choice of loss function can depend on the distribution of the data.
-  **Model Type**: Some models are designed to work better with specific loss functions.
