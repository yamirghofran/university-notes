title: Model Performance Metrics
---

A good model is a model that performs well on the [Testing Dataset](/machine-learning-foundations/training-and-holdout-datasets), i.e. generalizes well.

## Regression
- [Mean Squared Error](/machine-learning-foundations/mean-squared-error)
- [Median Absolute Error](/machine-learning-foundations/median-absolute-error)
- [Almost Correct Prediction Error Rate](/machine-learning-foundations/almost-correct-prediction-error-rate)
## Classification
- [Precision](/machine-learning-foundations/precision)
- [Recall](/machine-learning-foundations/recall)
- [Accuracy](/machine-learning-foundations/accuracy), and cost-sensitive and per-class accuracy.
- [AUC-ROC](/machine-learning-foundations/auc-roc)
- [Cohen's Kappa Statistic](/machine-learning-foundations/cohens-kappa-statistic)
## Ranking
- Precision and Recall
- [Cumulative Gain](/machine-learning-foundations/cumulative-gain) (CG)
- [Discounted Cumulative Gain](/machine-learning-foundations/discounted-cumulative-gain) (DCG)
- [Normalized discounted cumulative gain](/machine-learning-foundations/normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain)
- [Ideal discounted cumulative gain](/machine-learning-foundations/ideal-discounted-cumulative-gain)
