title: Reinforcement Learning
---

Focused on decision-making, solving a particular problem where decision-making is **sequential**, and the goal is long-term. e.g. game-playing, robotics, resource-management, logistics.

Uses the notion of an **agent** that learns by taking **actions** in an **environment**, receives feedback in the form of **reward** or **penalty** generated by those actions, and adjusts its **strategy(policy)** to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

RL learns an optimal policy for a given (set of) behavior and environment.
