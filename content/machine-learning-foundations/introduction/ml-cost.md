title: ML Cost
---

## Difficulty of the Problem
- Do we have ready made ML solutions (libraries, systems)?
- Depending on the problem, which type of algorithms do we need to design/implement (classification, regression, [Clustering](/machine-learning-foundations/algorithms/clustering), or [[Y2Q2/Machine Learning Foundations/Introduction/Reinforcement Learning]]) and how difficult is it to implement/deliver/maintain?

## Cost of the Data
- Can data be generated automatically?
- What is the cost of manual annotation of the data?
- How many examples are needed? Cannot be known in advance, but can be estimated from known published results or the organization's knowledge.

## Need for Accuracy
- Cost grows super-linearly with the accuracy requirement.
- How costly is each wrong prediction?
- What is the lowest tolerable accuracy level below which the model becomes impractical?
