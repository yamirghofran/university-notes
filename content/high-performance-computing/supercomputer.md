## Supercomputing Applications
Origin of supercomputing was used for simulating problems in nuclear physics
- tracking large systems of particles consisting of different species that may interact with one another and are not in equilibrium.
- non-equilibrium problems difficult to compute analytically & costly experimentally.
Other tracking large systems of particles with pair-wise interactions is the class that solves some set of partial-differential equations
- NaviereStokes equations for Fluid flow (engineering)
- Astrophysical source of gravitational radiation by LIGO
Other uses are: 
- Linear Algebra: climate modeling
- Graph problems: Machine learning, data analysis
- Stochastic systems: particle physics.
