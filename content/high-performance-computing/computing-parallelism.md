Parallelism is crucial in [HPC](/high-performance-computing/hpc) because it allows complex computational problems to be divided into smaller tasks that can be processed simultaneously. This leads to faster computation times and more efficient use of resources.

## Data Parallelism
- Distributing subsets of the same data across multiple processors, where each processor performs the same operation on its subset.
- e.g. Weather simulation models where each processor calculates the weather for a different region of the grid.
## Task Parallelism
- Distributing different tasks across multiple processors where each processor may perform a different operation.
- e.g. in a large-scale scientific simulation, one set of processors handles the computation of physical forces while another set of processors manages data input/output operations.
