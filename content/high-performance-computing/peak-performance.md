title: Peak Performance
---

Maximum rate at which operations can be accomplished **theoretically** by the hardware resources of a computer, measured in **flops** (floating-point operations per second).

- determined by **clock rate** provided by the device technology and hardware [parallelism](/high-performance-computing/computing-parallelism) determined by the computer architecture.
- Gordon Moore / Moore's Law: **device density** would increase by a factor of two every 2 years.
