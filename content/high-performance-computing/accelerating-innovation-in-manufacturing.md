title: Accelerating Innovation in Manufacturing
---

- Heavily used computer-aided engineering applications for product design and manufacturing processes (HPC key technology)
- Simulation as opposed to physical testing to reduce time to market through shortened design cycles while reducing development costs and delivering safer products to customers
- aerospace, automotive, consumer products, heavy industries, tire manufacturers, and electronics/semiconductor manufacturers
- Automotive: simulating crashes, structural analysis of noise, vibration, hardness, and stress, fluid-dynamics product design
- Aerospace: computational fluid-dynamics-based aerodynamics simulations and [virtual prototyping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/virtual-prototyping)
