title: Performance Metrics
---

There are multiple perspectives for measuring performance.

## FLOPS - time and number of operations
- Floating point operations per second
- Addition or multiplication of two real (or floating-point) numbers represented in some machine-readable and manipulatable form.
- kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa to represent 1000, 1 million, 1 billion, 1 trillion, 1 quadrillion, 1 quintillion.

## Benchmarks
A better measure than flops is how long a given problem takes to complete. This leads to benchmarks (standardized applications) for specific problems.
