- Oil and gas companies are some of the largest commercial users of supercomputing technologies
- Used for: exploration, production, and distribution
	- **exploration** for high-resolution seismic processing used to identify oil reservoirs through subsurface imaging
	- **production** workflows supercomputers are used in characterizing reservoirs and identifying the safest means of managing reserves
	- new [predictive analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/predictive-analytics) for effective **distribution** of petroleum products
