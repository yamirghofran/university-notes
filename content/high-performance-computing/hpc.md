A field of endeavor that relates to all facets of technology, methodology, and application associated with achieving the **greatest computing capability possible at any point in time and technology**.

The purpose of HPC is to derive **answers to questions** that cannot be adequately addressed alone through means of empiricism, theory, or even widely available or accessible commercial computers. It is considered a **"third pillar of science"** alongside and complementing both experimentation (empiricism) and mathematics (theory)

HPC includes work on **four basic building blocks**:
- Theory
	- numerical laws, physical models, speed-up performance, etc.
- Technology
	- multi-core, supercomputers, networks, storage, etc.
- Architecture
	- Shared-memory, distributed-memory, interconnects, etc.
- Software
	- Libraries, schedulers, monitoring, applications, etc.

The primary differentiator between HPC systems and other computers is that HPC systems are designed for high computational capacity and speed, coordinating multiple processors for **parallel operations**.

## HPC Key Requirements
- Parallel Processing
	-  coordinated multi-processor operations.
- Scalability
	- Capability to grow without disruption
- High-speed interconnects
	- Fast data transfer between components
- Reliable storage
	- Large, fast, and dependable data storage
- Efficient cooling
	- Counteract heat generated by intensive processing.
- Fault tolerance
	- Handle errors without significant work loss.
