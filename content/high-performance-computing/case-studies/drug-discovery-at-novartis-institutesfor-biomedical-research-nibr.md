- Traditional drug discovery is time-consuming & costly. HPC offers rapid, accurate in-silico simulations.
- Parallelism: Enables concurrent simulations of multiple compounds, speeding up potential drug candidate assessment.
- Hardware & Scaling: Fusion of traditional supercomputers & GPU nodes to supercharge molecular simulations.
- Key Tools:
	- GROMACS: Optimized for granular molecular dynamics.
	- Amber: Used for diverse biomolecular interactions.
- Optimization:
	- Performance monitoring ensures effective resource use.
	- Task granularity control tailors tasks to computational nodes.
- Impact & Benefits: Reduced time-to-discovery. Opportunity to revisit previously challenging compounds.
- Integrating AI in HPC: As AI's predictive modeling grows, how can it merge with HPC for a more holistic drug discovery approach? Consider challenges and opportunities.
