title: The Impact of Supercomputing on Climate Change ResearchNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
---

- Objective: Utilize HPC to model and predict global climate changes spanning years to centuries.
- Technical Details:
	- Model: Community Earth System Model (CESM)
	- Supercomputer: "Cheyenne" at NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center
	- Data Storage: GLADE system for petabytes of generated data
	- Visualization Tools: NCAR Command Language (NCL) & ParaView to interpret complex datasets.
- Application:
	- Initialization: Input real-world observational data into CESM.
	- Simulation: "Cheyenne" runs the model, concurrently simulating Earth systems.
	- Analysis: Results are visualized and patterns in climate variables are interpreted.
- Key Insights:
	- Supercomputing at NCAR offers detailed, long-range climate forecasts.
	- Predictions show potential shifts in global temperatures, precipitation, and sea levels.
	- Accurate policy-making requires high-quality, bias-free initial data.
- "Consider the impact of inaccuracies in initial observational data on climate predictions. How can researchers address potential biases?"
