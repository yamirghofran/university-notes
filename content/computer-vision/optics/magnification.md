$m$: magnification factor
$f$: focal length
$z_0$: distance of the object from pinhole

If $z_0$ is too small, different magnification factors will be applied to different points of the image.

In other words: if the depth of an object is much smaller than the average depth of an image, the magnification for the object can be considered constant:
$$\Delta z < \tilde{z}$$

If $z_0$ is too large (i.e. the object is far away), you can assume the rays come parallel to the optical axis. (orthographic projection)
