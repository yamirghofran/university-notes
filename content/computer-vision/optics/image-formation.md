Image formation is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane.

The goal of image formation is to understand the **geometric** and **photometric** relation between the scene and the image.

- **Geometric**: given a point in the scene, we want to calculate where it will be represented in the image plane.
- **Photometric**: given the brightness of a point in the scene, we want to compute the brightness of the point in the image.
