Hello, I'm Yousef. These are the notes I've been taking in my classes at IE, studying Computer Science & AI. My friends got a lot of value when I shared it with them, so I thought to share it with the world. I try to keep them nice and organized but some of them are messy. It is what it is. My favorites have been

- [Machine Learning Foundations](machine-learning-foundations)
- [Matrices & Linear Transformations](matrices-and-linear-algebra)
- [Physics for Computer Science](physics-for-computer-science)
- [Simulating and Modeling to Understand Change](simulating-and-modeling-to-understand-change)

“Very digestable and fast notes. Great reference especially with how everything is searchable and linked between each other.“ — Diego Oliveros

I also made [QuizBuilder.ai](https://quizbuilder.ai) to make quizzes about what I study and prepare better. Use it if you want.
